# 🧭 Project Overview

Welcome to the Contextual Language Model Assistant project! In this project, we focus on adding contextual knowledge and data with txt, csv, and other document formats to Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4. We leverage the LangChain library and deliver text and voice assistants for local data sources, making it easier for users to interact with and extract insights from their data.

## 🚧 Prerequisites

Before you start working on the project, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.10 installed
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with LangChain library (optional but recommended)

## 🎛 Project Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/user/knowlesge-agents.git
```

## 🗄️ Data

The project provides a sample `directory.csv` file as a starting point. However, you can replace it with your own data files in CSV, TXT, or other formats to unlock the potential of the LangChain library and the Large Language Model. Make sure you update the data file paths in the relevant scripts.
